# Some Computer Vision Ideas I have:

## 1. Finger Painting

### Description:

As an introduction to computer vision, I created a finger-painting Python application. Users can use their index finger to paint on a blank canvas, switching between defined colors. Currently, the colors supported are Red, Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow, Pink, Purple, Gray, and White. Feel free to add more colors with their respective RGB values if you wish.

Python Libraries:
- NumPy
- cv2
- mediapipe

Controls:
- A: Previous Color
- D: Next Color
- Enter: Save Image
- Esc: Quit
- Space: Erasor Mode
- P: Clear Image (to white)
- Drawing: Use your index finger!
